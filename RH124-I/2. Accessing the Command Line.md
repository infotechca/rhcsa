# 2. Accessing the Command Line
___

## 1. INTRODUCTION TO THE BASH SHELL
---
The default shell for users in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash).

When a regular user starts a shell, the default prompt ends with a `$` character,  as shown below.

```
haseeb@RHEL8 ~]$
```

The `$` character is replaced by a `#` character if the shell is running as the superuser, root.

The superuser shell prompt is shown below.
```
root@RHEL8 ~]#
```
___

## 2. SHELL BASICS
___
Commands entered at the shell prompt have three basic parts:

* **Command**
* **Options**
* **Arguments**

For example, the command 
```
haseeb@RHEL8 ~]$ ls -l /etc/fstab
```
**Command**	= `ls`
**Option**		= `-l`
**Argument** = `/etc/fstab`

## 3. LOGGING IN TO A LOCAL COMPUTER
___
The computer might have a hardware keyboard and display for input and output directly connected to it. This is the Linux machine's ***physical console***. The physical console supports multiple ***virtual consoles***, which can run separate terminals. Each virtual console supports an independent login session.

You can switch between them by pressing **Ctrl+Alt** and a function key (**F1** through **F6**)

| Keyboard Shortcut |Using Command		| Virtual Consoles  |
| ----------------- |:------------:  |:---------------:  | 
| **Ctrl+Alt+F1**   | `chve 1`				| **tty1**						|
| **Ctrl+Alt+F2**   | `chve 2`				| **tty2**						|
| **Ctrl+Alt+F3**   | `chve 3`				| **tty3**						|
| **Ctrl+Alt+F4**   | `chve 4`				| **tty4**						|
| **Ctrl+Alt+F5**   | `chve 5`				| **tty5**						|
| **Ctrl+Alt+F6**   | `chve 6`				| **tty6**						|

The computer might provide a graphical login prompt on one of the virtual consoles. You can use this to log in to a ***graphical environment***. The graphical environment also runs on a virtual console.

The **`who`** command is used to get information about currently logged in user on to system.

```
[haseeb@rhel8 ~]$ who

haseeb   tty2         2022-02-13 13:03 (tty2)
root     tty3         2022-02-13 13:03
user1    tty4         2022-02-13 13:03
user2    tty5         2022-02-13 13:04
user3    tty6         2022-02-13 13:04
```

## 4. LOGGING IN OVER THE NETWORK
___
Linux users and administrators often need to get shell access to a remote system by connecting to it over the network.

In Linux, the most common way to get a shell prompt on a remote system is to use **Secure Shell (SSH)**. Most Linux systems (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and macOS provide the **OpenSSH** command-line program `ssh` for this purpose.

```
PS C:\Users\S.A.Haseeb> ssh haseeb@192.168.100.100

The authenticity of host '192.168.100.100 (192.168.100.100)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:EVoOatN9/Cl3pPy4ZeIosFgOqLm7VSlsi2MDgwOsMXI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.100.100' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
haseeb@192.168.100.100's password:

Last login: Sun Feb 13 13:03:15 2022

[haseeb@rhel8 ~]$ who
haseeb   tty2         2022-02-13 13:03 (tty2)
haseeb   pts/1        2022-02-13 13:10 (192.168.100.1)
[haseeb@rhel8 ~]$
```

### LOGGING OUT
When you are finished using the shell and want to quit.
* You can enter the `exit` command to terminate the current shell session. 
```
[haseeb@rhel8 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 192.168.100.100 closed.
PS C:\Users\S.A.Haseeb>
```
* Alternatively,finish a session by pressing **Ctrl+D**.
